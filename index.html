  <p>I am a User Experience Design Engineer who likes to follow a minimalistic
    design approach under the concepts of modern design movements and
    a person who believes in the concept “Less is more”. Not only User
    Experience Design but also I have keen knowledge in brand
    management.
    I have completed my Bachelor of Design Degree under the specialization
    of Media and Communication Design at the Department of Integrated
    Design, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and currently I am reading to
    my MBA in Technology Management Stream under the same university.
    As 5+ years experienced UX Designer in the industry, I love everything
    that has to do with Research and Development, UI/UX Design and
    Development, Advertising and Art Direction, Brand Management, Mobile
    Application Design and I feel a true devotion for User Experience Design
    and Branding. I love working with people, especially if they have the same
    passion I have for what they do.
